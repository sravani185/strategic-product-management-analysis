trategic Product Placement Analysis

Strategic Product Placement Analysis is a Tableau-based data visualization project designed to evaluate how product placement strategies impact retail sales performance. The project transforms raw retail transactional data into interactive dashboards and story-based visualizations that support data-driven merchandising decisions.

In the competitive retail environment, product positioning such as eye-level shelves, end-cap displays, checkout counters, and promotional zones plays a critical role in influencing customer purchasing behavior. However, sales data is often scattered across spreadsheets and POS systems, making it difficult to extract meaningful insights. This project addresses that challenge by centralizing retail data into a dynamic and interactive Tableau dashboard.

The dashboard provides:

Store-wise sales distribution
Placement zone performance comparison
Monthly and quarterly sales trend analysis
Year-over-Year (YoY) sales growth comparison
KPI indicators such as Sales, Profit, Growth Percentage
Interactive filters (Store, Region, Category, Placement Zone, Year, Quarter)
Story-based navigation for executive-level presentations
The system architecture includes a data layer (CSV retail datasets), an application layer (Tableau calculated fields and business logic), and a user interface layer (interactive Tableau dashboards published via Tableau Public). The project uses more than 1000 retail sales records for analysis and ensures smooth dashboard performance with response time under 3–5 seconds.

Target users of this project include Retail Managers, Merchandising Teams, Category Managers, Marketing Analysts, and Senior Executives who require actionable insights for layout optimization and revenue growth.

Key advantages of this project include centralized retail analytics, interactive visualization, improved decision-making speed, and enhanced revenue optimization. Future improvements can include real-time POS data integration, predictive sales forecasting, AI-based placement recommendations, and mobile-friendly dashboards.
